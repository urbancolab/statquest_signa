    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This notebook is heavily based on the tutorial in Chapter 5 of *[Hands-On Large Language Models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-large-language/9781098150952/)* by [Jay Alammar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jalammar/) and [Maarten Grootendorst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgrootendorst/). This book is amazing, and I highly recommend purchasing it ASAP. Anyway, I changed a few things from their original code and descriptions, mainly by adding to what they already did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here (illustrated below) is that we start with a bunch of documents about all kinds of things, and we want to cluster the documents and give each cluster a title. We'll use an Encoder-Only LLM, or Representative AI, to cluster the documents based on similar themes, topics, and meanings rather than just keywords or neighboring words (like we did with Word Embedding). Then, we'll use a Decoder-Only LLM, or Generative AI, to give each cluster an excellent title. And we'll do all of this without knowing anything about these documents in advance. So, this gives us a great tool for exploratory data analysis and dealing with vast archives that we otherwise would need help with.\n",

Having too many embedding values, or dimensions, results in sparse data that can be difficult to cluster and is an example of [The Curse of Dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). The illustration below shows the curse in action. On the left, we have 3 data points in a 2-dimensional graph. Each point is relatively far from the others, and thus, it's difficult to know how to best cluster them. However, in the center, we reduced the dimension to just the y-axis and, on the right side, we we see points A and B are relatively close to each other compared to point C. Thus, we'll put points A and B together in a cluster.\n",
