    "Position Encoding helps the transformer keep track of the order of the words in the input and the output. For example, in the picture below, we see that the two phrases **Squatch eats pizza** and **Pizza eats Squatch** both have the exact same words, but, due to differences in the word order, have very different meanings. Thus, keeping track of word order is very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of ways for a transformer to keep track of word order, but one popular method is to use a series of alternating sine and cosine curves (seen below). The number of sine and cosine squiggles depends on how many numbers, or word embedding values, we use to represent each token. In the context of Transformers, the number of numbers, or word embedding values, we use to to represent each token is the **dimension** of the transformer. So, if the transformer's dimension is 2, meaning that it uses 2 numbers to represent each token, then we only need one sine and one cosine squiggle. \n",

    "<img src=\"./images/pos_encoding_2.png\" alt=\"More sine and cosine squiggles for position encoding\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see in the illustration above, the additional pair of sine and cosine squiggles have a wider period (they repeat less frequently) than the first pair. Increasing the period for each additional pair of squiggles ensures that each position is represented by a unique combination of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The reason why we are bothering to create a class to do positional encoding, instead of just adding this code directly to the transformer, is that both the Encoder and Decoder need to use it. So, by creating a class that does positional encoding, we can code it once, and then just create as many instances of it as we need (which, in this case, is two times).\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALSO NOTE:** Since the position encoding values never change, meaning that the first token always uses the same position encoding values regardless of what that token is, we can precompute them and save them in a lookup table. This makes adding position encoding values super fast.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Self-Attention** is a type of attention used in Encoder-Decoder transformers and Encoder-Only transformers. It allows every word in a phrase to define a relationship with any other word in the phrase, regardless of the order of the words. In other words, if the the phrase is **The pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good!**, then the word **it** can define it's relationship with every word in that phrase, including words that came after it, like **tasted** and **good**, as illustrated by the blue arrows in the figure below.\n",

    "**Masked Self-Attention** is used by all types of transformers (Encoder-Only, Encoder-Decoder, and Decoder-Only) and it allows each word in a phrase to define a relationship with itself and the words that came before it. In other words, **Masked Self-Attention** prevents the transformer from \"looking ahead\". This is illustrated below where the word **it** can define relationships with itself and everything that came before. In Encoder-Only and Encoder-Decoder transformers, **Masked Self-Attention** is used during training, when we know what the output should be, but we still force the decoder to generate it one token at a time, and thus, limiting attention to only output words that came earlier. In contrast, Decoder-Only transformers use **Masked Self-Attention** all the time, on the input and the output, during training and during inference. Thus, even though the Decoder-Only transformer doesn't have to generate the input, and thus, can see all of it during training and during inference, it still only allows the attention values for each word to depend on words that came before it.\n",

On the right, we see the equation for Masked Self-Attention and the only difference it has from the equation on the left is the addition of a **Mask** matrix, **M**, that prevents words that come after a specific **Query** from being included in the final attention scores. \n",

For example, if the **Query** is for the first token **\\<SOS>**, then Masked Self-Attention will ignore the values calculated with **Keys** for **Let's** and **go**, because those tokens come after **\\<SOS>**.\n",
